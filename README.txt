Hello, Everyone!
On this repository, I am going to share everything that I made according to my videos on Youtube about JavaScript; the idea is to teach everyone the basic commands (not the programming logic).
If you liked the idea, you can support us by donating (PayPal: roberto396g@hotmail.com), and subscribe on my Youtube Channel, which is MundoTi.
Would you like to contact me? Skype: robertoviniciusdasilva
